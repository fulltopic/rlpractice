## Notes

* For step = 10 cases, some test cases showed that when the ball was lucky and bounced several times in the upper layers and then bounced out of the wall from far end of the paddle, the paddle would be lost. It kept still and lost track of the ball. Maybe more steps would help

* _55 is the best for test18 test.

* _95 hang on 287/370
